 Allows the replicator to run when the app goes into the background.
 The default value is NO which means that the replicator will suspend itself when the app
 goes into the background, and will automatically resume when the app is brought into
 the foreground. The replicator will also resume when the -start method is called; this
 allows the replicator to be started or run when the app is already in the background.
 The replicator will suspend itself or stop (for a non-continuous replicator) when the
 replicator is inactive or the background task is expired.
 
 If the runInBackground property is set to YES, the replicator
 will allow to continue running in the background without suspension; it is the
 app's responsibility to manage the replicator running status when the app enters into the
 background, and comes back to the foreground.
