 This is intended to be read by a developer for purposes of optimizing the query, especially
 to add database indexes. It's not machine-readable and its format may change.
 
 As currently implemented, the result is two or more lines separated by newline characters:
 * The first line is the SQLite SELECT statement.
 * The subsequent lines are the output of SQLite's "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN" command applied to that
 statement; for help interpreting this, see https://www.sqlite.org/eqp.html . The most
 important thing to know is that if you see "SCAN TABLE", it means that SQLite is doing a
 slow linear scan of the documents instead of using an index. */

 once.

 will not reflect any changes made to the database afterwards. */
