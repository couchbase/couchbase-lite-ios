    framework's reachability API. You can get called when reachability changes by either
    KV-observing the properties, or setting an "onChange" block.
    "Reachable" means simply that the local IP stack has resolved the host's DNS name and knows how
    to route packets toward its IP address. It does NOT guarantee that you can successfully connect.
    Generally it just means that you have an Internet connection. */
