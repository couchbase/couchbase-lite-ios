/** A CBLBlob appears as a property of a CBLDocument; it contains arbitrary binary data,
    tagged with a MIME type.
    Blobs can be arbitrarily large, and their data is loaded only on demand (when the `content`
    or `contentStream` properties are accessed), not when the document is loaded.
    The document's raw JSON form only contains the CBLBlob's metadata (type, length and a digest of
    the data) in a small object. The data itself is stored externally to the document, keyed by
    the digest. */
