/** CBLQueryResult represents a single row in the query result. The projecting result value 
    can be accessed either by using a zero based index or by a key corresponding to the
    CBLQuerySelectResult objects given when constructing the CBLQuery object. 
    
    A key used for accessing the projecting result value could be one of the followings:
    * The alias name of the CBLQuerySelectResult object.
    * The last component of the keypath or property name of the property expression used 
      when creating the CBLQuerySelectResult object.
    * The provision key in $1, $2, ...$N format for the CBLQuerySelectResult that doesn't have
      an alias name specified or is not a property expression such as an aggregate function 
      expression (e.g. count(), avg(), min(), max(), sum() and etc). The number suffix 
      after the '$' character is a running number starting from one. */
