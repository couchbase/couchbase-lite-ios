/** A compiled database query.
    You create a query by calling the CBLDatabase method createQueryWhere:. The query can be
    further configured by setting properties before running it. Some properties alter the
    behavior of the query enough to trigger recompilation; it's usually best to set these only
    once and then reuse the CBLQuery object. You can use NSPredicate / NSExpression variables
    to parameterize the query, making it flexible without needing recompilation. Then you just
    set the `parameters` property before running it. */
