acknowledges that a breach of its obligations to Couchbase under this
Agreement, other than the payment obligations, will result in irreparable
and continuing damage for which monetary damages may not be sufficient,
and agrees that Couchbase will be entitled to receive in addition to
its other rights and remedies hereunder or at law, injunctive and/or
other equitable relief. All remedies of Couchbase set forth in this
Agreement are cumulative and in addition to, and not in lieu of any
other remedy of Couchbase as law or in equity. 4. Services.
4.1 This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses, but not to Free
Licenses. The parties may agree to have Couchbase provide additional
Professional Services, which shall be set forth on the applicable Order or
SOW signed by both parties. Such Professional Services shall be governed
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 5. Proprietary Rights.
 5.1 The Software (and any modifications or derivatives thereto) and
all Documentation and Professional Services, are and shall remain the
sole property of Couchbase and its licensors. Except for the license
rights granted under this Agreement, Couchbase and its licensors retain
all right, title and interest in and to the Software, Documentation and
Professional Services, including all intellectual property rights therein
and thereto. 5.2 The Software may include third party open source
software components and such third-party components shall be licensed to
Customer under the terms of the applicable open source license conditions
and/or copyright notices that can be found in the licenses file,
Documentation or materials accompanying the Software. 5.3 If Customer
is the United States Government or any contractor thereof, all licenses
granted hereunder are subject to the following: (a) for acquisition
by or on behalf of civil agencies, as necessary to obtain protection as
"commercial computer software" and related documentation in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subpart 12.1212
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its
successors; and (b) for acquisition by or on behalf of the Department
of Defense (DOD) and any agencies or units thereof, as necessary to obtain

227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1
and 227.7202-3, and its successors, manufacturer is Couchbase, Inc.
6. Support. 6.1 This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses,
but not to Free Licenses. Couchbase will provide Customer with the
level of Support indicated on the applicable Order and paid for by
Customer. For all Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices within a specific
Production Deployment, all such nodes and instances must be at the same
level of Support, including any that are used for disaster recovery or
backup that are associated with the specific Production Deployment. For
the avoidance of doubt, each specific Production Deployment can have
its own level of Support. Similarly, all Licensed Nodes and Licensed
Devices in a development or test environment must be at the same level
of Support but such Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices may be at a
different support level than the Production Deployment(s). 6.2 When
using the Cross-Data Center Replication feature, Customer must have all
Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices at the same level of Support for all
instances on all sides of the replication connection, including if one
side of the connection is only used for disaster recovery or backup.
 7. Fees. 7.1 This Section applies only to Enterprise Licenses, but
not to Free Licenses. Customer will pay Couchbase the Fee(s) in advance,
unless otherwise indicated in the applicable Order. All payments are
non-cancelable, not subject to the Limitation of Liability in Section 12
below, and shall be made in the currency stated on the applicable Order
and are due within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, unless
otherwise stated on the invoice. Late payments will bear interest at
the lesser of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month or the maximum
rate allowed by applicable law. Customer will reimburse Couchbase for all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) in collecting any overdue amounts. 7.2 All Fees payable
under this Agreement are: (a) net amounts and are payable in full,
without deduction for taxes or duties of any kind; (b) exclusive of,
and Customer is responsible for, all duties and taxes (including Value
Added Tax which shall be paid by Customer, if applicable, at the rate
and in the manner for the time being prescribed by law), except for
taxes based on Couchbase's net income; and (c) non-refundable except
to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement. 7.3 If
Customer sends Couchbase a purchase order ("PO"), the PO will be deemed
a binding contract offer which Couchbase may accept by signing the
PO or sending a written order acknowledgment of acceptance of the PO
(thereby forming a mutually agreed Order governed by this Agreement);
in such case the only terms listed on the accepted PO which will form
the Order are the Commercial Details; and all other terms (whether
additional or conflicting with this Agreement) on the PO will be void and
without effect, even if Couchbase signs the PO.  All accepted POs will
automatically be governed by this Agreement (even if the PO does not
reference this Agreement). It is expressly agreed that Section 7 shall
apply in respect of any PO sent by Customer and accepted by Couchbase. It
is expressly agreed that this Section 7.3 shall apply in respect of any
PO sent by Customer to Couchbase. 8. Records Retention and Audit.
 8.1 Customer shall maintain complete and accurate records to permit
Couchbase to verify Customer's compliance with this Agreement (including
the number of Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices used by Customer),
and provide Couchbase with such records within ten (10) days of request.
 8.2 Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, Couchbase
may audit Customer's use of the Software to solely assess whether Customer
is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit will be
conducted during regular business hours at Customer's facilities and will
not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities. Customer
will provide Couchbase with access to the relevant Customer records
and facilities. If an audit reveals that Customer has underpaid fees
to Couchbase, then Couchbase will invoice Customer, and Customer will
promptly pay Couchbase for such underpaid fees based on Couchbase's price
list in effect at the time the audit is completed. If the underpaid fees
exceed five percent (5%) of the Fee paid by Customer for the Software,
then Customer will also pay Couchbase's reasonable costs of conducting
the audit. 9. Confidentiality. 9.1 Customer and Couchbase will
maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information. "Confidential
Information" means any proprietary information received by the other
party during, or prior to entering into, this Agreement that a party
should know is confidential or proprietary based on the circumstances
surrounding the disclosure, including the Software and any non-public
technical and business information (including pricing).  Confidential
Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally
known to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement
by the receiving party; (b) is rightfully known by the receiving party
at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality to
the disclosing party; (c) is independently developed by the receiving
party without use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information;
or (d) the receiving party rightfully obtains from a third party without
restriction on use or disclosure.

9.2 The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other
party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose
except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights
under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of
and prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of the disclosing party's
Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes to
protect its own confidential information and in no event shall use less
than reasonable care. 9.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, the
receiving party will, at the disclosing party's option, promptly return
or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the
disclosing party's Confidential Information. A party may disclose the
other party's Confidential Information to the extent required by law
or regulation. 10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 10.1 THE SOFTWARE,
DOCUMENTATION AND ANY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER ARE
PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND NEITHER COUCHBASE, ANY
OF ITS AFFILAITES OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "COUCHBASE PARTIES")
REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR PROFESSIONAL

SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS CUSTOMER MAY SELECT FOR USE,
THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED,

at its sole option and expense, (i) procure for Customer the right to
continue using the affected Software, Documentation or Professional
Services; (ii) replace or modify the affected Software, Documentation
or Professional Services that infringe so that they do not infringe;

Customer a pro-rata amount of the Fees for the affected Professional
Services. 11.3 Customer Indemnification. Customer will indemnify
and defend Couchbase from and against any damages awarded against

(iv) attributable to any third party open source software components
(v) to the extent based on Customer's use of the Software other than
in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Documentation, (vi)
based on Customer's continued allegedly infringing activity after being
notified thereof or after being provided a replacement or modifications

(b) as to Professional Services, (i) based on modifications to the
Professional Services made by a party other than Couchbase, to the
extent a claim would not have occurred but for such modifications,

of this Agreement, and such use causes such infringement, (iii) based on
infringement resulting from the combination of the Professional Services,
with any hardware, data or software not provided by Couchbase, (iv) based
on Couchbase's compliance with any materials, designs, specifications or
instructions provided by Customer, or (v) based on Customer's continued

unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the

supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements
regarding the subject matter hereof. No additional or conflicting
terms set forth on any purchase order, order acknowledgement or other
