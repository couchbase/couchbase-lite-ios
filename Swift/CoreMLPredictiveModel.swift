import CoreML

/// CoreMLPredictiveModel is a Core ML based implementation of the PredictiveModel
/// protocol. Basically the CoreMLPredictiveModel used a Core ML model to return
/// prediction results.
///
/// CoreMLPredictiveModel automatically converts between Couchbase Lite data and Core ML
/// data when calling into the MLModel object to return prediction results. All Core ML
/// data types including Int64, Double, String, Dictionary, MultiArray, Image, and Sequence
/// are supported.
///
/// When the MLObject has a single input and the input type is Image, CoreMLPredictiveModel
/// will use Vision framework via the VNCoreMLModel to process the input image and call into
/// the MLModel object. The CoreMLPredictiveModel supports all VNObservation types including
/// VNClassificationObservation, VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation, and VNPixelBufferObservation
/// as mentioned in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vncoremlrequest.

/// However there is a compatibility limitation when the VNCoreMLModel returns
/// VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation or VNPixelBufferObservation results that the MLModel must
/// return a single output, otherwise the observation outputs cannot be mapped to the MLModel
/// outputs. When the VNCoreMLModel cannot be used to result the prediction result,
/// CoreMLPredictiveModel will fall back to use the MLModel instead.
///
/// When converting blob data to VNPixelBuffer for an input image, only ARGB pixel format
/// is currently supported. However this limitation is applied only when the VNCoreMLModel cannot
/// be used.
