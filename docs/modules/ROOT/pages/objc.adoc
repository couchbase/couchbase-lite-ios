SDK API References]

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

Xcode
^^^^^

The public facing API has completely changed in Couchbase Lite 2.0 and will require a re-write to upgrade an application that is using Couchbase Lite 1.x. To update an Xcode project built with Couchbase Lite 1.x:

* Remove the existing *CouchbaseLite.framework* dependency from the Xcode project.
* Remove all the Couchbase Lite 1.x dependencies (see the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/installation/ios/index.html#ios-amp-tvos[1.x installation guide]).
* Install the Couchbase Lite 2.0 framework in your project (see the link:swift.html#_frameworks[installation options]). At this point, there will be many compiler warnings. Refer to the examples on this page to learn about the new API.
* Build & run your application.

Database Upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Databases that were created with Couchbase Lite 1.2 or later can be
read using the 2.0 API. Upon detecting it is a 1.x database file format,
Couchbase Lite will automatically upgrade it to the new format used in
2.0. This feature is only available for the default storage type (i.e
not for ForestDB databases). Additionally, the automatic migration
feature does not support encrypted databases, so if the 1.x database is
encrypted you will first need to disable encryption using the Couchbase
Lite 1.x API (see the
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/couchbase-lite/native-api/database/index.html#step-2-enabling-encryption[1.x
Database Guide]).

===== Handling of Existing Conflicts

The automatic upgrade functionality does not copy any conflicting
revisions to the new database. The motivation for this functionality is
related to the way conflicts are being handled in Couchbase Lite 2.0
(see link:swift.html#_handling_conflicts[Handling Conflicts]). Optionally, existing conflicts in the 1.x database can be resolved with the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/couchbase-lite/native-api/revision/index.html[1.x API] prior to the database being upgraded to 2.0.

===== Handling of Existing Attachments

Attachments that were persisted in the 1.x database file will be copied to the 2.0 database file. Note that in Couchbase Lite 2.0, the `Attachment` API has been renamed to `Blob` API. The functionally is essentially identical but the internal schema for attachments has changed. In 1.x they were stored under the `_attachments` field and in Couchbase Lite 2.0 they will be stored like other value types. The automatic upgrade functionality will not update the internal schema for attachments, so they will still be accessible under the `_attachments` field. The following example shows how to retrieve an attachment that was created in a 1.x database with the 2.0 API.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=1x-attachment]
----

Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

The replication protocol used in Couchbase Lite 2.0 has been re-designed from the ground up and it is not backwards compatible with the 1.x replication protocol. Therefore, to use replication with Couchbase Lite 2.0, the target Sync Gateway instance must also be upgraded to 2.0.

Sync Gateway 2.0 will continue to accept clients that connect through the 1.x protocol. It will automatically use the 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects through "http://localhost:4984/db" and the 2.0 replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 2.0 client connects through "ws://localhost:4984/db". This allows for a smoother transition to get all your user base onto a version of your application built with Couchbase Lite 2.0.

Database
~~~~~~~~

New Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the top-level entity in the API, new databases can be created using
the `Database` class by passing in a name, configuration, or both. The
following example creates a database using the `Database(name: String)`
method.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=new-database]
----

Just as before, the database will be created in a default location.
Alternatively, the `Database(string name, DatabaseConfiguration config)`
initializer can be used to provide specific options in the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLDatabaseConfiguration.html[`DatabaseConfiguration`]
object such as the database directory.

Finding a Database File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the application is running on the iOS simulator, you can easily
locate the application's sandbox directory using the
https://simpholders.com/3/[SimPholders] utility.

CLI tool
^^^^^^^^

The Couchbase Lite `.zip` file available from the
https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[downloads page] contains a CLI which
can be used on *.cblite2* files.

Logging
^^^^^^^

The log messages are split into different domains (`LogDomains`) which
can be tuned to different log levels. The following example enables
`verbose` logging for the `replicator` and `query` domains.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=logging]
----

Loading a pre-built database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your app needs to sync a lot of data initially, but that data is
fairly static and won't change much, it can be a lot more efficient to
bundle a database in your application and install it on the first
launch. Even if some of the content changes on the server after you
create the app, the app's first pull replication will bring the database
up to date.

To use a prebuilt database, you need to set up the database, build the
database into your app bundle as a resource, and install the database
during the initial launch. After your app launches, it needs to check
whether the database exists. If the database does not exist, the app
should copy it from the app bundle using the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLDatabase.html#/c:objc(cs)CBLDatabase(cm)copyFromPath:toDatabase:withConfig:error:[`[CBLDatabase copyFromPath:toDatabase:withConfig:error:]`]
method as shown below.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=prebuilt-database]
----

Document
~~~~~~~~

In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object — a
collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of
data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects. Every
document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically
generated (as a UUID) or determined by the application; the only
constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't
be changed.

Initializers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The `MutableDocument()` initializer can be used to create a new
document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
* The `MutableDocument(withID: String)` initializer can be used to
create a new document with a specific ID.
* The `database.document(withID: String)` method can be used to get a
document. If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `nil`.
This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already
exists in the database.

The following code example creates a document and persists it to the
database.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=initializer]
----

Mutability
^^^^^^^^^^

By default, when a document is read from the database it is immutable.
The `document.toMutable()` method should be used to create an instance
of the document which can be updated.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=update-document]
----

Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the
`saveDocument` method is called.

Typed Accessors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Document` class now offers a set of
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Protocols/CBLDictionary.html#/Type%20Setters[`property accessors`]
for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point
and strings. These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON
encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

In addition, as a convenience we offer `Date` accessors. Dates are a
common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the
convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format. The following
example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back
using the `document.date(forKey: String)` accessor method.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=date-getter]
----

If the property doesn't exist in the document it will return the default
value for that getter method (0 for `getInt`, 0.0 for `getFloat` etc.).
To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use
the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLDocument.html[`[Document contains:key]`]
method.

Batch operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to
group them together. The following example persists a few documents in
batch.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=batch]
----

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other
`Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make
changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not
see partial changes. But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and
due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway
or other devices will receive your changes all at once.

Blobs
^^^^^

We've renamed "attachments" to "blobs", for clarity. The new behavior
should be clearer too: a `Blob` is now a normal object that can appear
in a document as a property value. In other words, you just instantiate
a `Blob` and set it as the value of a property, and then later you can
get the property value, which will be a `Blob` object. The following
code example adds a blob to the document under the `avatar` property.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=blob]
----

The `Blob` API lets you access the contents as in-memory data (a `Data`
object) or as a `InputStream`. It also supports an optional `type`
property that by convention stores the MIME type of the contents.

In the example above, "image/jpeg" is the MIME type and "avatar" is the
key which references that `Blob`. That key can be used to retrieve the
`Blob` object at a later time.

When a document is synchronized, the Couchbase Lite replicator will add
an `_attachments` dictionary to the document's properties if it contains
a blob. A random access name will be generated for each `Blob` which is
different to the "avatar" key that was used in the example above. On the
image below, the document now contains the `_attachments` dictionary
when viewed in the Couchbase Server Admin Console.

image::attach_replicated.png[,500]

A blob also has properties such as `"digest"` (a SHA-1 digest of the
data), `"length"` (the length in bytes), and optionally `"content_type"`
(the MIME type.) The data is not stored in the document, but in a
separate content-addressable store, indexed by the digest.

This `Blob` can be retrieved on the Sync Gateway REST API at
http://localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1[localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1].
Notice that the blob identifier in the URL path is "blob_1" (not
"avatar").

Query
~~~~~

Database queries have changed significantly. Instead of the map/reduce
algorithm used in 1.x, they're now based on expressions, of the form
"return ____ from documents where ____, ordered by ____", with semantics
based on Couchbase Server's N1QL query language.

There are several parts to specifying a query:

* SELECT: specifies the projection, which is the part of the document
that is to be returned.
* FROM: specifies the database to query the documents from.
* JOIN: specifies the matching criteria in which to join multiple
documents.
* WHERE: specifies the query criteria that the result must satisfy.
* GROUP BY: specifies the query criteria to group rows by.
* ORDER BY: specifies the query criteria to sort the rows in the result.

Indexing
^^^^^^^^

Before we begin querying documents, let's briefly mention the importance
of having a query index. A query can only be fast if there's a
pre-existing database index it can search to narrow down the set of
documents to examine.

The following example creates a new index for the `type` and `name`
properties.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-index]
----

If there are multiple expressions, the first one will be the primary
key, the second the secondary key, etc.

*Note:* Every index has to be updated whenever a document is updated, so
too many indexes can hurt performance. Thus, good performance depends on
designing and creating the _right_ indexes to go along with your
queries.

SELECT statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the SELECT statement, you can query and manipulate JSON data. With
projections, you retrieve just the fields that you need and not the
entire document. This is especially useful when querying for a large
dataset as it results in shorter processing times and better
performance.

A SelectResult represents a single return value of the query statement.
Documents in Couchbase Lite comprise of the document properties
specified as a Dictionary of Key-Value pairs and associated metadata.
The metadata consists of document Id and sequence Id associated with the
Document. When you query for a document, the document metadata is not
returned by default. You will need to explicitly query for the metadata.

* http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLQuerySelectResult.html#/c:objc(cs)CBLQuerySelectResult(cm)all[`[CBLQuerySelectResult all]`]:
Returns all properties associated with a document.
* `[CBLQuerySelectResult expression:[`http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLQueryExpression.html[`CBLQueryExpression`]`property:"name"]`:
Returns the `name` property associated with a document.
* `[CBLQuerySelectResult expression:`http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLQueryMeta.html[`CBLQueryMeta`]`.id]`:
Returns the document ID.
* `SelectResult.expression(Expression.meta().sequence)`: Returns the
sequence ID (used in replications).

You can specify a comma separated list of `SelectResult` expressions in
the select statement of your query. For instance the following select
statement queries for the document `_id` as well as the `type` and
`name` properties of all documents in the database. In the query result,
we print the `_id` and `name` properties of each row using the property
name getter method.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-select-meta]
----

The `SelectResult.all()` method can be used to query all the properties
of a document. In this case, the document in the result is embedded in a
dictionary where the key is the database name. The following snippet
shows the same query using `SelectResult.all()` and the result in JSON.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-select-all]
----

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "travel-sample": {
            "callsign": "MILE-AIR",
            "country": "United States",
            "iata": "Q5",
            "icao": "MLA",
            "id": 10,
            "name": "40-Mile Air",
            "type": "airline"
        }
    },
    {
        "travel-sample": {
            "callsign": "TXW",
            "country": "United States",
            "iata": "TQ",
            "icao": "TXW",
            "id": 10123,
            "name": "Texas Wings",
            "type": "airline"
        }
    }
]
----

WHERE statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to SQL, you can use the where clause to filter the documents to
be returned as part of the query. The select statement takes in an
`Expression`. You can chain any number of Expressions in order to
implement sophisticated filtering capabilities.

Comparison
++++++++++

The `Expression`'s
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLQueryExpression.html[comparison
operators] can be used in the WHERE statement to specify on which
property to match documents. In the example below, we use the `equalTo`
operator to query documents where the `type` property equals "hotel".

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

----

Collection Operators
++++++++++++++++++++

http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLQueryExpression.html#/Collection%20operators:[Collection
operators] are useful to check if a given value is present in an array.
The following example uses the `Function.arrayContains` to find
documents whose `public_likes` array property contain a value equal to
"Armani Langworth".

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "name": "Apple Droid",
    "public_likes": ["Armani Langworth", "Elfrieda Gutkowski", "Maureen Ruecker"]
}
----

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-collection-operator]
----

Like Operator
+++++++++++++

The
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLQueryExpression.html#/c:objc(cs)CBLQueryExpression(im)like:[`like`]
operator can be used for string matching. It is recommended to use the
`like` operator for case insensitive matches and the `regex` operator
(see below) for case sensitive matches.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of type `landmark`
where the name property exactly matches the string "Royal engineers
museum". Note that since `like` does a case insensitive match, the
following query will return "landmark" type documents with name matching
"Royal Engineers Museum", "royal engineers museum", "ROYAL ENGINEERS
MUSEUM" and so on.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-like-operator]
----

Wildcard Match
++++++++++++++

We can use `%` sign within a `like` expression to do a wildcard match
against zero or more characters. Using wildcards allows you to have some
fuzziness in your search string.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark"
where the name property matches any string that begins with "eng"
followed by zero or more characters, the letter "e", followed by zero or
more characters. The following query will return "landmark" type
documents with name matching "Engineers", "engine", "english egg" ,
"England Eagle" and so on. Notice that the matches may span word
boundaries.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-like-operator-wildcard-match]
----

Wildcard Character Match

We can use `_` sign within a like expression to do a wildcard match
against a single character.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of type "landmark"
where the `name` property matches any string that begins with "eng"
followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending in the letter "r".
The following query will return "landmark" `type` documents with the
`name` matching "Engineer", "engineer" and so on.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-like-operator-wildcard-character-match]
----

Regex Match
+++++++++++

The `regex` expression can be used for case sensitive matches. Similar
to wildcard `like` expressions, `regex` expressions based pattern
matching allow you to have some fuzziness in your search string.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark"
where the name property matches any string (on word boundaries) that
begins with "eng" followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending
in the letter "r". The following query will return "landmark" type
documents with name matching "Engine", "engine" and so on. Note that the
`\b` specifies that the match must occur on word boundaries.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-regex-operator]
----

JOIN statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JOIN clause enables you to create new input objects by combining two
or more source objects.

The following example uses a JOIN clause to find the airline details
which have routes that start from RIX. This example JOINS the document
of type "route" with documents of type "airline" using the document ID
(`_id`) on the "airline" document and `airlineid` on the "route"
document.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-join]
----

GROUP BY statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can perform further processing on the data in your result set before
the final projection is generated. The following example looks for the
number of airports at an altitude of 300 ft or higher and groups the
results by country and timezone.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "airport123",
    "type": "airport",
    "country": "United States",
    "geo": { "alt": 456 },
    "tz": "America/Anchorage"
}
----

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=query-groupby]
----

[source,text]
----
There are 138 airports on the Europe/Paris timezone located in France and above 300 ft
There are 29 airports on the Europe/London timezone located in United Kingdom and above 300 ft
There are 50 airports on the America/Anchorage timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
There are 279 airports on the America/Chicago timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
There are 123 airports on the America/Denver timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
----

ORDER BY statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to sort the results of a query based on a given
expression result. The example below returns documents of type equal to
"hotel" sorted in ascending order by the value of the title property.

Full-Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a full-text search (FTS) query, you must have created a full-text
index on the expression being matched. Unlike regular queries, the index
is not optional. The following example inserts documents and creates an
FTS index on the `name` property.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=fts-index]
----

Multiple properties to index can be specified in the
`Index.fullTextIndex(withItems: [FullTextIndexItem])` method.

With the index created, an FTS query on the property that is being
indexed can be constructed and ran. The full-text search criteria is
defined as a `FullTextExpression`. The left-hand side is the full-text
index to use and the right-hand side is the pattern to match.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=fts-query]
----

In the example above, the pattern to match is a word, the full-text
search query matches all documents that contain the word 'buy' in the
value of the `doc.name` property.

Full-text search is supported in the following languages: danish, dutch,
english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian,
portuguese, romanian, russian, spanish, swedish and turkish.

The pattern to match can also be in the following forms:

* *prefix queries:* the query expression used to search for a term
prefix is the prefix itself with a '*' character appended to it. For
example:
+
....
"'lin*'"
-- Query for all documents containing a term with the prefix "lin". This will match
-- all documents that contain "linux", but also those that contain terms "linear",
--"linker", "linguistic" and so on.
....
* *overriding the property name that is being indexed:* Normally, a
token or token prefix query is matched against the document property
specified as the left-hand side of the `match` operator. This may be
overridden by specifying a property name followed by a ":" character
before a basic term query. There may be space between the ":" and the
term to query for, but not between the property name and the ":"
character. For example:
+
....
'title:linux problems'
-- Query the database for documents for which the term "linux" appears in
-- the document title, and the term "problems" appears in either the title
-- or body of the document.
....
* *phrase queries:* a phrase query is a query that retrieves all
documents that contain a nominated set of terms or term prefixes in a
specified order with no intervening tokens. Phrase queries are specified
by enclosing a space separated sequence of terms or term prefixes in
double quotes ("). For example:
+
....
"'"linux applications"'"
-- Query for all documents that contain the phrase "linux applications".
....
* *NEAR queries:* A NEAR query is a query that returns documents that
contain a two or more nominated terms or phrases within a specified
proximity of each other (by default with 10 or less intervening terms).
A NEAR query is specified by putting the keyword "NEAR" between two
phrase, token or token prefix queries. To specify a proximity other than
the default, an operator of the form "NEAR/" may be used, where is the
maximum number of intervening terms allowed. For example:
+
....
"'database NEAR/2 "replication"'"
-- Search for a document that contains the phrase "replication" and the term
-- "database" with not more than 2 terms separating the two.
....
* *AND, OR & NOT query operators:* The enhanced query syntax supports
the AND, OR and NOT binary set operators. Each of the two operands to an
operator may be a basic FTS query, or the result of another AND, OR or
NOT set operation. Operators must be entered using capital letters.
Otherwise, they are interpreted as basic term queries instead of set
operators. For example:
+
....
'couchbase AND database'
-- Return the set of documents that contain the term "couchbase", and the
-- term "database". This query will return the document with docid 3 only.
....
+
When using the enhanced query syntax, parenthesis may be used to specify
the precedence of the various operators. For example:
+
....

Ordering results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's very common to sort full-text results in descending order of
relevance. This can be a very difficult heuristic to define, but
Couchbase Lite comes with a fairly simple ranking function you can use.
In the `OrderBy` array, use a string of the form `Rank(X)`, where `X` is
the property or expression being searched, to represent the ranking of
the result.

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

Couchbase Mobile 2.0 uses a new replication protocol based on
WebSockets. This protocol has been designed to be fast, efficient,
easier to implement, and symmetrical between the client and server.

Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

⚠️ The new protocol is *incompatible* with CouchDB-based databases. And
since Couchbase Lite 2 only supports the new protocol, you will need to
run a version of Sync Gateway that
link:../references/couchbase-lite/release-notes/index.html#compatibility-matrix[supports
it].

To use this protocol with Couchbase Lite 2.0, the replication URL should
specify WebSockets as the URL scheme (see the "Starting a Replication"
section below). Mobile clients using Couchbase Lite 1.x can continue to
use *http* as the URL scheme. Sync Gateway 2.0 will automatically use
the 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects
through "http://localhost:4984/db" and the 2.0 replication protocol when
a Couchbase Lite 2.0 client connects through "ws://localhost:4984/db".

Starting Sync Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Download Sync Gateway] and start it
from the command line with the configuration file created above.

[source,bash]
----
~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway
----

For platform specific installation instructions, refer to the Sync
Gateway
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/installation/sync-gateway/index.html[installation
guide].

Starting a Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replication objects are now bidirectional, this means you can start a
`push`/`pull` replication with a single instance. The replication's
parameters can be specified through the
http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-objc/db022/Classes/CBLReplicatorConfiguration.html[`ReplicatorConfiguration`]
object; for example, if you wish to start a `push` only or `pull` only
replication. The following example creates a `pull` only replication
instance with Sync Gateway.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=replication]
----

As shown in the code snippet above, the URL scheme for remote database
URLs has changed in Couchbase Lite 2.0. You should now use `ws:`, or
`wss:` for SSL/TLS connections. You can access the Sync Gateway
`_all_docs` endpoint
http://localhost:4984/db/_all_docs?include_docs=true to check that the
documents are successfully replicated.

Couchbase Lite 2.0 uses WebSockets as the communication protocol to
transmit data. Some load balancers are not configured for WebSocket
connections by default (NGINX for example); so it might be necessary to
explicitly enable them in the load balancer's configuration (see
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/sync-gateway/nginx/index.html[Load
Balancers]).

By default, the WebSocket protocol uses compression to optimize over
speed and bandwidth. The level of compression is set on Sync Gateway and
can be tuned in the configuration file
(link:../guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html#2.0/replicator_compression[`replicator_compression`]).

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As always, when there is a problem with replication, logging is your
friend. The following example increases the log output for activity
related to replication with Sync Gateway.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=replication-logging]
----

Replication Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `replication.status.activity` property can be used to check the
status of a replication. For example, when the replication is actively
transferring data and when it has stopped.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=replication-status]
----

The following table lists the different activity levels in the API and
the meaning of each one.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|State |Meaning
|`STOPPED` |The replication is finished or hit a fatal error.

|`OFFLINE` |The replicator is offline as the remote host is unreachable.

|`CONNECTING` |The replicator is connecting to the remote host.

|`IDLE` |The replication caught up with all the changes available from
the server. The `IDLE` state is only used in continuous replications.

|`BUSY` |The replication is actively transferring data.
|=======================================================================

Handling Network Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an error occurs, the replication status will be updated with an
`Error` which follows the standard HTTP error codes. The following
example monitors the replication for errors and logs the error code to
the console.

[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/SampleCodeTest.m[tags=replication-error-handling]
----

When a permanent error occurs (i.e `404`: not found, `401`:
unauthorized), the replicator (continuous or one-shot) will stop
permanently. If the error is temporary (i.e waiting for the network to
recover), a continuous replication will retry to connect indefinitely
and if the replication is one-shot it will retry for a limited number of
times. The following error codes are considered temporary by the
Couchbase Lite replicator and thus will trigger a connection retry.

- `408`: Request Timeout
- `429`: Too Many Requests
- `500`: Internal Server Error
- `502`: Bad Gateway
- `503`: Service Unavailable
- `504`: Gateway Timeout
- `1001`: DNS resolution error

Handling Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in Couchbase Lite 2.0, document conflicts must be resolved
using automatic conflict resolution or in the application. This
functionality aims to simplify the default behavior of conflict handling
and save disk space (conflicting revisions will no longer be stored in
the database). There are 2 different `save` method signatures to specify
how to handle a possible conflict:

* `save(document: MutableDocument)`: when concurrent writes to an
individual record occur, the conflict is automatically resolved and only
one non-conflicting document update is stored in the database. The
Last-Write-Win (LWW) algorithm is used to pick the winning revision.
* `save(document: MutableDocument, concurrencyControl: ConcurrencyControl)`:
attempts to save the document with a concurrency control. The
concurrency control parameter has two possible values:
** `lastWriteWins`: The last operation wins if there is a conflict.
** `failOnConflict`: The operation will fail if there is a conflict.

Similarly to the save operation, the delete operation also has two
method signatures to specify how to handle a possible conflict:

* `delete(document: Document)`: The last write will win if there is a
conflict.
* `delete(document: Document, concurrencyControl: ConcurrencyControl)`:
attemps to delete the document with a concurrency control. The
concurrency control parameter has two possible values:
** `lastWriteWins`: The last operation wins if there is a conflict.
** `failOnConflict`: The operation will fail if there is a conflict.

Database Replicas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database replicas is available in the *Enterprise Edition* only
(https://www.couchbase.com/downloads). Starting in Couchbase Lite 2.0,
replication between two local databases is now supported. It allows a
Couchbase Lite replicator to store data on secondary storage that can
then be ported to a different device. It would be especially useful in
scenarios where a user's device is damaged and the data needs to be
moved to a different device. Note that the code below won't compile if
you're running the *Community Edition* of Couchbase Lite.

Certificate Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Couchbase Lite supports certificate pinning. Certificate pinning is a
technique that can be used by applications to "pin" a host to it's
certificate. The certificate is typically delivered to the client by an
out-of-band channel and bundled with the client. In this case, Couchbase
Lite uses this embedded certificate to verify the trustworthiness of the
server and no longer needs to rely on a trusted third party for that
(commonly referred to as the Certificate Authority).

The `openssl` command can be used to create a new self-signed
certificate and convert the `.pem` file to a `.cert` file (see
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/sync-gateway/configuring-ssl/index.html#creating-your-own-self-signed-certificate[creating
your own self-signed certificate]). You should then have 3 files:
`cert.pem`, `cert.cer` and `key.pem`.

The `cert.pem` and `key.pem` can be used in the Sync Gateway
configuration (see
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.5/guides/sync-gateway/configuring-ssl/index.html#installing-the-certificate[installing
the certificate]).

On the Couchbase Lite side, the replication must be configured with the
`cert.cer` file.

[source,objectivec]

This example loads the certificate from the application sandbox, then
converts it to the appropriate type to configure the replication object.
