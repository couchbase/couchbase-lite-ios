**Couchbase Lite** is a lightweight [Apache CouchDB][1]-compatible database engine suitable for embedding into mobile or desktop apps. Think of it this way: If CouchDB is MySQL, and Couchbase Server is Oracle, then Couchbase Lite is SQLite.

By "_CouchDB-compatible_" I mean that it can replicate with CouchDB, and that its data model and high-level design are "Couch-like" enough to make it familiar to CouchDB/Couchbase developers. Its REST API is nearly identical, though it doesn't support a few CouchDB features, like user accounts, that aren't useful in mobile apps. Its implementation is _not_ based on CouchDB's (it's not even written in Erlang.) It _does_ support replication to and from CouchDB.

By "_suitable for embedding into mobile apps_", I mean that it meets the following requirements:

 * Small code size; currently about 350kbytes of ARM7 code. (Code size is important to mobile apps, which are often downloaded over cell networks.)
 * Quick startup time on relatively-slow CPUs; ideally 100ms or less.
 * Low memory usage with typical mobile data-sets. The expectation is the number of documents will not be huge, although there may be sizable multimedia attachments.
 * "Good enough" performance with these CPUs and data-sets.

And by "_mobile apps_" we're focusing on iOS and [Android][11], although there's no reason we couldn't extend this to other platforms like Windows Phone. And it's not limited to mobile OSs -- the Objective-C implementation runs on Mac OS as well, and on Linux and other Unix-like OSs via [GNUstep][12].

## More Information

* There's lots more information on the [wiki][2].
* There's a "Grocery Sync" [demo app][18] for iOS, that implements a simple shared to-do list.
* Or if you want to ask questions or get help, join the [mailing list][17].

## Platforms ##

 * **Mac OS X** -- 10.7.2 or higher.
 * **iOS** -- 5.0 or higher.
 * **Linux, BSD, etc** -- Any platform [supported by][13] current [GNUstep][12] and libobjc2.
 * **MS Windows** -- As [supported by][13] GNUstep using MingW.
 * **Android / Java** -- Has its own source base and [repository][11].

## Requirements ##

 * It's written in Objective-C.
 * Xcode 4.5+ is required to build it (Clang 3.1+, with GNUstep).
 * Runtime system requirements for Apple platforms are iOS 5+, or Mac OS X 10.7.2+.

## License ##

 * Couchbase Lite itself is under the Apache License 2.0.
 * [FMDB][5], by [Gus Mueller][8], is under the MIT License.
 * [Google Toolbox For Mac][10] is under the Apache License 2.0.
 * [CocoaHTTPServer][9], by Robbie Hanson, is under the BSD License.
 * [MYUtilities][6] (portions of which are copied into the vendor/MYUtilities directory) is under the BSD License. (But note that I, Jens, wrote MYUtilities and would have no problem re-licensing it under Apache for use here.)

## Development Status ##

Couchbase Lite (aka TouchDB) 1.0.1 was released on January 15, 2013.

In general, the "stable" branch represents the latest stable release, while the "master" branch has the latest commits and may not be solid. Any other branches are probably experimental.

## Downloading Couchbase Lite ##

* [Latest stable build][20].
* [Latest revisions][19] (built hourly after any commits. Each archive is timestamped. May not be stable; use at your own risk.)

## Building Couchbase Lite ##

### On a Mac ###

(You might prefer to just [download][20] the latest stable release. But if you want to build it yourself...)

For full details see the [wiki page][7]. The basic steps are:

 1. Clone the Couchbase Lite repository to your local disk.
 2. In that directory run "`git submodule init`" and then "`git submodule update`". This will clone the dependent library repos (such as [FMDB][5] and [MYUtilities][6]) into the vendor/ subdirectory.
 3. Open the Xcode project and build the "Mac Framework" and/or "iOS Framework" schemes.

### With GNUstep ###

Please refer to the files [BUILDING.txt][14] and [SETUP.txt][15] in the `GNUstep` directory.
