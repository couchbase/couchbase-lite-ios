/** Generic model class for CouchbaseLite documents.
    There's a 1::1 mapping between these and CBLDocuments; call +modelForDocument: to get (or create) a model object for a document, and .document to get the document of a model.
    You should subclass this and declare properties in the subclass's @@interface. As with NSManagedObject, you don't need to implement their accessor methods or declare instance variables; simply note them as '@@dynamic' in the class @@implementation. The property value will automatically be fetched from or stored to the document, using the same name.
    Supported scalar types are bool, char, short, int, double. These map to JSON numbers, except 'bool' which maps to JSON 'true' and 'false'. (Use bool instead of BOOL.)
    Supported object types are NSString, NSNumber, NSData, NSDate, NSArray, NSDictionary, NSDecimalNumber. (NSData and NSDate are not native JSON; they will be automatically converted to/from strings in base64 and ISO date formats, respectively. NSDecimalNumber is not native JSON as well; it will be converted to/from string)
    Additionally, a property's type can be a pointer to a CBLModel subclass. This provides references between model objects. The raw property value in the document must be a string whose value is interpreted as a document ID. */

/** Returns the CBLModel associated with a CBLDocument, or creates & assigns one if necessary.
    If the CBLDocument already has an associated model, it's returned. Otherwise a new one is instantiated.
    If you call this on CBLModel itself, it'll delegate to the CBLModelFactory to decide what class to instantiate; this lets you map different classes to different "type" property values, for instance.
    If you call this method on a CBLModel subclass, it will always instantiate an instance of that class; e.g. [MyWidgetModel modelForDocument: doc] always creates a MyWidgetModel. */
