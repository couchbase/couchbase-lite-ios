      endKey is "foo" then the key "foolish" in the index will be matched, but not "fong".) Or if
      the endKey is an array, any array beginning with those elements will be matched. (For
      example, if the endKey is [1], then [1, "x"] will match, but not [2].) If the key is any
      other type, there is no effect.
    * A value of 2 assumes the endKey is an array and treats its final item as a prefix, using the
      rules above. (For example, an endKey of [1, "x"] will match [1, "xtc"] but not [1, "y"].)
