#  Added by Jens Alfke on 5/16/12.

# Version 2.0 (updated for Xcode 4, with some fixes)
# Changes:
#    - Works with xcode 4, even when running xcode 3 projects (Workarounds for apple bugs)
#    - Faster / better: only runs lipo once, instead of once per recursion
#    - Added some debugging statemetns that can be switched on/off by changing the DEBUG_THIS_SCRIPT variable to "true"
#    - Fixed some typos
# 
# Purpose:
#   Create a static library for iPhone from within XCode
#   Because Apple staff DELIBERATELY broke Xcode to make this impossible from the GUI (Xcode 3.2.3 specifically states this in the Release notes!)
#   ...no, I don't understand why they did this!

# Based on: original script from Eonil (main changes: Eonil's script WILL NOT WORK in Xcode GUI - it WILL CRASH YOUR COMPUTER)
